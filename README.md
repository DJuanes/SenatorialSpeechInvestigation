#Introduction
This is an illustrative project intended to demonstrate a simple, yet not quite as simple as Word Count, NLP algorithm implemented in Hadoop Map Reduce.  This is also intended to demonstrate my opinions on unit testing Map Reduce jobs.

#Description
The purpose of the project is to take a dataset of around 1400 speeches from Senators along with an ideal-point mapping onto the number line of the politicians based around the work of [Simon Jackman](http://jackman.stanford.edu/blog/?p=2084) to do the following:

* Find partition points separating Conservative, Moderate and Liberal senators by dividing the probability density into thirds (see histogram)
* Use this partition to construct three corpuses associated with Conservative, Moderate and Liberal senators
* Preprocess using a Porter Stemmer and rank the tokenized terms by [Inverse Document Frequency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25#IDF_Information_Theoretic_Interpretation)
* Take the ranked terms and output the terms that are important in the corpus associated with one political orientation but not the others.

The partition of the probability space is detailed here:

#Current Caveats
* A naive partition based on an even partition of the probability space may be unsuitable.  I didn't know of a better, politically agnostic way to do this.
* This is not as efficient as it could be.  I could have used term IDs instead of the actual terms, but I wanted the Map Reduce job to be as clear as possible

This code is mostly an intellectual lark and a demonstration of NLP done using Map Reduce that does not require the baggage of Mahout.

#Usage
##Prerequisites
To execute this, you must have:

* A JDK installed
* Maven 2 or higher installed

To generate the histogram, you need to have R.
To generate the presentation from the Cleveland CHUG, you need latex

##To generate the full example
From the command line, in the political-nlp-analysis directory, execute

     mvn integration-test

You can then use the political-nlp-analysis/generate_top_words.sh script
to generate the top words for a particular political orientation thusly:

     generate_top_words.sh {LIBERAL, MODERATE, CONSERVATIVE} <number of terms>

You can reconstruct the density plot using the political-nlp-analysis/src/main/R/generate_histogram.sh script:

     generate_histogram.sh <path to ideal_points.csv>
