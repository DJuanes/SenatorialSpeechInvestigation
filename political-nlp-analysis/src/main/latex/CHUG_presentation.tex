\section{Introduction}

\frame{\frametitle{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hi, I'm Casey\pause
  \begin{itemize}
  \item I work at Explorys\pause
  \item I work with Hadoop and the Hadoop ecosystem daily\pause
  \item I am a recovering Mathematician\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item Caveat emptor
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not all problems can be solved with Map Reduce
  \item This is a batch processing system (i.e. not realtime)\pause
  \end{itemize}

\item I'm going to talk about some of the best practices that I've seen\pause
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Some of these are common knowledge\pause
  \item Some of these don't show up until you've been up 'til 3AM debugging a problem.\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item These are my opinions and not necessarily the opinions of my employer.
\end{itemize}

\section{Designing a Map Reduce Algorithm}

\subsection{Performance}
\frame{\frametitle{Performance considerations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Setup and teardown costs, so keep the HDFS block size large\pause
\item Mappers, Reducers and Combiners have memory constraints\pause
\item Transmission costs dearly 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use Snappy, LZO, or (soon) LZ4 compression at every phase\pause
  \item Serialize your objects tightly (e.g. not using Java Serialization)\pause
  \item Key/values emitted from the map phase had better be linear with a {\bf small} constant..preferably below $1$\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item Strategies
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Intelligent use of the combiners\pause
  \item Use Local Aggregation in the mapper to emit a more complex value.\pause
  \item Ensure that all components of your keys are necessary in the sorting logic.  If any are not, push them into the value.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Testing}
\frame{\frametitle{Unit/Integration Testing Methodologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item First off, do it.\pause
\item Unit test individual mappers, reducers, combiners and partitioners
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Actual unit tests.  This will help debugging, I promise.
  \item Design components so that dependencies can be injected via polymorphism when testing\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item Minimally verify that keys
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can be serialized and deserialized
  \item $hashcode()$ is sensible (Remember: the $hashcode()$ for enum is not stable)
  \item $compareTo()$ is reflexive, symmetric and jives with $equals()$\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item Integration test via single user mode hadoop if you like, but I think it's mostly pretty useless.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Quality Assurance Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item The output of processing large amounts of data is often large\pause
\item Verify statistical properties via MR
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If statistical tests fit within Map Reduce, then use MR\pause
  \item If not, then sample the dataset and verify with R, Python or whatever.\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item Do outlier analysis and thresholding based QA\pause
\item Data analysis is hard and often requires specialized skills
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Enter a new breed: the data scientist\pause
  \item Stats + Computer Science + Domain knowledge\pause
  \item Often not a software engineer
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\subsection{Debugging}
\frame{\frametitle{Debugging Methodologies}
\begin{itemize}
\item Better to catch it at the unit test level\pause
\item If you can't, I suggest the following technique
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Investigatory map reduce job to find the data causing the issue. \pause
  \item Single point if you're lucky, if not then a random sample using reservoir sampling\pause
  \item Take the data and integrate it into a unit test.\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf DO NOT}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use print statements to debug unless you're sure of the scope.\pause
  \item Use counters where the group or name count grows more than a fixed amount.\pause
  \end{itemize}
\item {\bf DO}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use a single counter in the actual job if the job doesn't finish\pause
  \item Use a map reduce job that outputs suspect input data into HDFS
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Conclusion}

\frame{\frametitle{Sample Code}
\begin{itemize}
\item I've created a simple Hadoop project in the NLP domain to illustrate some of these points
\item Implements a Map Reduce algorithm that analyzes the senatorial speeches and generates the most statistically important words used, comparing across multiple political orientations
\item It features
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Full example of a Map Reduce algorithm that is not word count
  \item Unit tests for the Keys and Values
  \item Integration test that executes the full lifecycle
  \end{itemize}
